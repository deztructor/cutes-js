* cutes.js

Javascript libraries created specially for QtScript javascript cutes
environment and also adapted or reused (json, narwhal etc.)

** Module system

cutes uses module system similar to node.js and narwhal to allow
easier porting of the code from this libraries. Some qualities of the
QtScript result in I have not got _exports_ to be used not only in
assignments but also to get and use its members inside module
functions because it is global variable and QtScript resolves it when
the function is called and creating it in a local environment does not
provide control on its behaviour. There is an option to create local
environment and to capture it in closure but this is in TODO list.
